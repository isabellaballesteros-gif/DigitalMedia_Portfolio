    <h2> About the Project</h2>
        <p> <a href="https://codepen.io/Isabella-Ballesteros/full/EaaKRKp">CLICK HERE</a> to view my GIF Project in Codepen. The project instructions were to code a blog from scratch informing viewers about the history of GIFs while including GIFs you created. I researched about the origin of GIFs on the internet, learning about their creator and the reason for the creation. I then discovered the popularity and surprising lawsuits of the history of GIFS. This blog was coded completely from scratch with demos provided by the professor. I have had some prior knowledge to coding a website in Chilton middle school because I took a very short computer science class. I recall I made my own hot-pink website all about me and the things I love with different pages and links. It was a very long time ago so all of the basic coding that I learned then was all lost. This class has helped me get back into website coding. Though there were primer projects to help us get used to website coding, this was the first project where I coded a real blog with information and designs entirely from scratch. There was not much specific information I had to include for the content, I had to do research on my own to create an original blog. This project especially helped me learn how to use classes, ids, and bulletpoints which were all very new to me. The project even gave me creative freedom to stylize the blog so I added a pixel-like title font and CSS code to add color. This project also contains GIFs I created, in which I will explain below as separate pieces.</p>

  <h2> About the Project</h2>
  <p> 
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/IBallesteros/sketches/G1D9JbB9J">CLICK HERE</a> to view my code and animation to this creative coding project. Press the play button to show the result of the code. We were tasked to code a robot illustration using P5.Js with an original design and concept. The robot is inspired by my favorite drink, a strawberry matcha latte with boba. It is a silly idea and concept, but it gave me inspiration to make a very cute and detailed robot. I used layers of squares and circles to create the illustration. I learned how to change oppacity for the shadows and make a simple animation with the straw. This was my first time coding using JavaScript so the project was very challenging yet rewarding, especially knowing that this piece is original. Javascript was especially difficult during our primer project, which was to create an abstract piece and experiment with different shapes. I was frustrated on how to create the codes and graphing them without numbers. It was like learning a new language I had no prior knowledge to. I felt like giving up, especially when many of my classmates were already making aesthetic designs for their primer project. But I never gave up. I spent countless hours on the robot creative coding project. I used my weaknesses as strengths as you can see, I only used basic shapes such as circles, linear lines, and rectangles but I arranged them to look complex. I utilized a very simple color pallette that resembles that of a cartoon. The animations are very simple because they are only side to side. But with all the simplicity, I made a design with a lot of thought put into it and I am very confident in my work. This project overall gave me a new sense of understanding about art on a very technical level.</p>

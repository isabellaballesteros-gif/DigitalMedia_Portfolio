    <h3> About the Project</h3>
        <p> <a href="https://youtu.be/0KO6n8c2l0E">CLICK HERE</a> to view my midterm video project. The project was to create a narrative video utilizing everything we have learned so far about videography and video programs, whether it is live action or animated. I chose to do an animated story using procreate, Adobe Animate, and Adobe Premiere pro. The one minute story is about a homesick Filipino girl missing the comfort of food and family while she is away at college. She follows mysterious steam that leads her to a familiar red door. This story was inspired by my life and my biggest challenge this year, leaving home and my culture for college. Though my home is not that far, it still feels like a drastic change to my lifestyle. The color and style of the video starts as sketchy lines and grayscale, symbolizing the mess of emotions and overall sadness the character feels. But as the video progresses, more bright colors and concrete lines are shown, symbolizing that the character feels happier and comfort. I was inspired by many hand animated films and movies, I have always wanted to make short films. I had a short time frame to complete this video but it was the best work I could do.</p>

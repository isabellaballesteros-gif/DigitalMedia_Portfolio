   <h3>About the Project</h3>
  <p> <a href="https://adobeaero.app.link/dqhi2hENqNb">CLICK HERE</a> <strong> for the link but read the instructions first all in blue text! If you know how Adobe Aero works, skip to the black text.</strong>

  <p1>To access the Adobe Aero immersion space, you need to download the Adobe Aero App on your phone. The link leads to a QR code which can be scanned using your phone camera. The QR code then takes you to the Adobe Aero app which allows you to view the project. Thank you for following the instructions!</p1> 
   <p>This project is my first time using Adobe Aero in which I created a space using 3D model pre-sets. All of the models, except for the photos and illustrations, are all pre-sets. I rotated, re-sized, and placed the models in a way that made the space look like a room. This was an introduction assignment to the program so it took me a while to get comfortable with the mechanics. I then added a GIF onto the space and a photo which gives the illusion of paper. The GIF is from the movie <em>Ponyo</em> and the space is inspired by the movie, childlike and aesthetic. I chose to make this kind of space because I feel like this style reflects me. My art style is very colorful, bright, and more light hearted. Prior to the assignment, I had little to no experience with 3D modeling and placement with a space. I tried to learn the basics of blender but it felt very complicated. I would love to be more proficent in 3D in future classes because it is very interesting. </p>

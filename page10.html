    <h3> About the Project</h3>
    <p> <a href="https://youtu.be/PwprbucGQ5A">CLICK HERE</a> to access the video. This is a group project using Adobe Character Animator. The project was to create a short story with different characters interacting with each other. My team members and I decided to do a comedic story about different sea creatures going to a school dance. Each person was in charge of creating, voicing, and recording scenes with one character and I was the pink jellyfish. Adobe Character Animator allows artists to animate easily through motion capture and puppetting. My team members all used pre-made character puppets but I was unable to find a jellyfish puppet and I was new to Adobe Character Animator. So I thought creatively and downloaded the whale shark puppet into Adobe Photoshop. I then deleted parts of the whale shark and replaced them with my own illustrations of the jellyfish (only keeping the mouth and eyes of the whale shark). That way it could still capture my expressions and move like a puppet without having to start from scratch.</p>

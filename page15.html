    <h2> About the Project</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Cafe For You is a cozy website designed for cozy people to have something in the background for study sessions, practicing hobbies, yoga, sleep, or ambience in any occasion they want. Set in a cafe, users can choose what background cafe, food item, drink item, music, and sound effects they want. All assets are hand drawn and given a storybook, cozy feel. Though customization is limited due to time management, I have put quality into the designs to assure simple, cute aesthetics. It also includes sound loops and overlapping audios so users can enjoy music and ambience however they want to.</p>
        
        <p>To add a physical element to make my website more engaging, I was inspired by prints that independent artists make of their artwork. I had an idea that I make custom and more unique designs, sounds, and music that people can't get on the main site. People can buy the physical artwork print and the back includes a link to the secret cafe. If I were to do more secret cafes, I would make them blind prints so that way, customers wouldn't know which cafe they get and it makes it cute and exciting while enjoying both worlds.</p>
        
        <p>The main inspiration for this final project were YouTube videos to fall asleep, study, or have in the background. I love these videos but sometimes, I feel like I can't find the perfect one or I want a different version of the one I got used to. I would waste my time scrolling for the perfect video because it didn't have visuals or sound I wanted. For my project, I wanted to create a website where users can customize their visuals and sounds to fall asleep, study, or have in the background. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to make a cute, drawn game or website as I learned basic coding. I was also always inspired by food and cozy environments. Now, I finally made my cozy, interactive website that I am proud of.</p>

  <h2> About the Project</h2>
 <p> The goal of this project was to create a new album cover design for a music band of our choice. First, we had to choose an image related to the theme or mood of the album overall and glitch the image by editing the image code with <em>NotePad++</em>. I chose to do a famous Rococo style painting for the album <em>A Night at the Opera</em> by Queen. I discovered this art style from my art history class in Fall 2024. I chose the painting because the style of the painting was seen as rebellious in art history, breaking traditional boundaries while still having a traditional feel. It was seen as scandelous, too lighthearted, and unlikeable at first but people grew to enjoy it. I believe that the Queen album and songs have the same experience of being seen as weird but becoming beloved. I generated three different glitched variations of the painting which are shown as thumbnail photos below the final image. Ordered from left to right is the original photo and then the glicthed photos. The code of the photo is changed even more, making the original photo more glitched than the last. I then took the second glitched image and added more designs using Adobe Photoshop. Because I had proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, I added a layer mask of a red high heel in replacement of the lady's dainty shoe for a modern, rebellious touch. I also played around with the text to match the vibe of the band. As a little design element, I added each of the four band member's <em>Hot Space</em> album cover colors at the bottom right corner to represent the four members with the band name.</p>
